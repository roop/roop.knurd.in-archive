<h3>Jekyll</h3>
<p>
    'Blogging from the commandline? Yay!' is what I thought of
    <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
    when it swam into my ken, so as to say.
</p>
<p>
    Jekyll is an übersimple blog generator, and by virtue of being übersimple
    gives you a lot of control. You write posts as html-lets in files and
    Jekyll converts them into a static html site. Host the static files
    someplace, and lo! you have your blog. 
    <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> can do the hosting for you,
    and best part is, Github does both publishing and version control for
    the blog at one shot. True, that means versioning with 
    <a href="http://git-scm.com/">the best version controller in the world</a>.
    And sure, you do all this from the bash command line. 
    Erm, you do use the browser, but only to preview what your post will
    look like.
</p>
<p>
    So when I wanted to put up a website for myself at
    <a href="http://knurd.in/">knurd.in</a>
    (yeah, I was pretty much addicted to
    <a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/">Pratchett</a> when I'd registered that 
    domain), I thought I'll give Jekyll <a href="/about/jekyll-install-commands.html">a try</a> rather than just link to
    <a href="http://roop.blogspot.com/">my blogspot blog</a>.
    After I import my past posts
    using <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues#issue/24">
    this rss importer</a>, create the
    <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> templates and
    <code>git push</code> to Github, I have the site working at
    <a href="http://roop.github.com/">roop.github.com</a>.
</p>

<h3>Google App Engine</h3>

<p>
    But to tie it to the knurd.in domain, I find
    that I have to pay Github (horror).
    They don't ask for much, but there are times when I prefer free over
    cheap, and this is one of them.
    So I turn to <a href="http://appspot.com/">Google App Engine</a>
    to host the static html that Jekyll generates. All it takes is a simple
    <a href="http://github.com/roop/roop.github.com/blob/c7f9f4020e1da210f1bfa57ffba1fc7eb6ae3bdf/app.yaml">app.yaml</a>.
</p>
<p>
    But while I just had to do a <code>git push</code> with Github (which
    will call jekyll in the server side with a git hook), I now have
    two more commands to run: One, <code>jekyll</code> to generate the
    static site and two, <code>appcfg.py update</code> to push the site
    to our Google App. Mmm, I guess I can live with that.
</p>

<h3>Disqus</h3>

<p>
    Next in line: Comments. How does a static site support dynamic content
    like comments? Enter <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, which seems
    to be a popular choice among current Jekyll users. Disqus stores your comments
    for you, and if you add some html-lets in your template, it can insert 
    the comments into your page. Nice javascript trick, heh?
</p>
<p>
    But I want my existing comments, though they are few and far between. So
    I try the Blogger importer that Disqus provides. It contacts blogger and
    gets the comments but thinks they are in the roop.blogspot.com domain,
    so they don't appear at knurd.in. I have to tell it somehow that the urls
    of the posts have changed. I export the xml out of Disqus, edit the XML 
    and change the domain. But, hey, I can't import it back into Disqus -
    it only imports from elsewhere, not it's own export format. Damn.
</p>
<p>
    Ok, the other XMLs it can import are export formats of it's direct
    competitors: <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a>
    and <a href="http://js-kit.com/">JS-Kit</a> (both of which, incidentally,
    I had never heard of before). So maybe I can import my blogger comments
    into one of these, export it from there, and then import it into Disqus?
    Mmm, that just might work. (Hey, so Disqus is sorta forcing me to
    try out it's competitors. Ironic, huh?)
</p>
<p>
    Hard luck. JS-Kit's blogger importing is a paid service, and Intense
    Debate has disabled it's blogger importer "due to some bugs". Neither
    offer a Disqus importer. Aaargh.
</p>
<p>
    But Disqus finally saved the day for me, by offering a
    <a href="http://help.disqus.com/entries/100880-configure-and-override-comment-system-behaviors">disqus_url</a>
    variable that I can override in javascript on a per-page basis. So I
    can tell Disqus to consider the url as from roop.blogspot.com even if
    it's served from knurd.in. Nice. So all I hafta do now is to populate this
    variable by some
    <a href="http://github.com/roop/roop.github.com/commit/701c208545662a087cdcf95abef8f550280626cb">liquid markup magic</a>. Yay, comments are working too.
