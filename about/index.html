        Call me Roop. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - I
        created a blogger account. (Sorry, Moby Dick.) And I've been a
        very reluctant and occasional blogger ever since, but a blogger nevertheless.
        And, per how things normally evolve from there, here is my site,
        floated Dec 2009. Behold and, er, just behold it, ok?

    <h3>About Ook</h3>
    <p>
        Ook is the most beautiful word in the language of The Librarian in
        the Discworld, because it's the only word in that language. By necessity,
        it's also the most expressive word, accomodating a multitude of emotions
        with intonations. See the
        <a href="http://www.lspace.org/books/toc/toc-orangutan.html">story</a>
        and the
        <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/ook.html">programming language</a>
        for more information.  (Er. This doesn't actually fit here, but
        three subsections look just about right for this page.)
