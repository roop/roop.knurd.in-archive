I stumbled on to this <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/2008/06/changing-your-point-of-view.html">nice piece</a> by Duncan, and a <a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2008/06/27/change-your-point-of-view/">follow up</a> by bbum, about taking a different point of view while photographing something. Made me dig up my photos to see how many of them employ a somewhat unusual line of sight. And I have to say there weren't many.<br /><br /><table><tbody valign="middle" style="text-align: left;"><tr> <td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3097613541/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3224/3097613541_ac7d696e32_m.jpg" alt="bcb6"/></a><br />Shot in IIMB during a discussion-ish session in <a href="http://barcampbangalore.org/wiki/BCB6">Barcamp Bangalore 6</a><br /></td> <td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3090426156/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/3090426156_912b2c0fd4_m.jpg" alt="auto"/></a><br />Self-portrait from inside an auto-rickshaw in Delhi<br /></td> </tr><tr> <td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3089336755/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/3089336755_ae41229e00_m.jpg" alt="underbelly"/></a> <br />My poor old camera was placed face up on the <i>road</i> to get this, on self-timer and an uberlong exposure. This is the underbelly of the Eiffel Tower.<br /></td><td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/168988170/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/72/168988170_f7389725a4_m.jpg" alt="umbrellae"/></a><br />The drizzle brought out the umbrellas, and they always look good from the top. Shot from a rooftop corridor in the Notre-Dame de Paris.<br /></td></tr><tr> <td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3089606809/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/3089606809_aea7c35ec2_m.jpg" alt="cycle-rickshaw"/></a><br />Shot sitting in another rickshaw just in front of this one, this photo would have been impossible without the pull out LCD. Moradabad, India.<br /></td><td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3090426172/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/3090426172_aa5758d50e_m.jpg" alt="doggie"/></a><br />This probably looks like normal line of sight, but is shot from a low height to put the doggy in perspective. Antibes, France.<br /></td> </tr><tr> <td><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3090426164/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/3090426164_5ba9427ac6_m.jpg" alt="aurobindo"/></a><br /></td> <td><br />This one should really have been a simple shot, if only the scene had not been behind a grille. This is all I got out of poking my camera into a locked room in the Aurobindo Institute, Calcutta.<br /></td> </tr></tbody> </table><br />Equally, if not more, interesting is fellow photographers trying too hard for a certain point of view:<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3089606839/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3224/3089606839_5fb2369801_t.jpg"></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roop/3090508672/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3153/3090508672_49d09f7851_t.jpg"></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5850977-131104477063296908?l=roop.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
