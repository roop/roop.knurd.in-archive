I'd been tinkering with remixing songs with Cool Edit for a while, and this is a piece that I had left hanging for a long time. So I just added a drum roll and a crash over the weekend to put an end to it. It sounds (to me atleast) less like a remix and more like a medley of songs that forms "a different whole", and so I'm calling this a musicollage (not to be confused with Jorge Sylvester's 1996 album). I might actually try and make more, so if you particularly dont like it, do let me know :). For arbitrary reasons, this piece is called "Domapo". <br /> <br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Domapo</span> <br /><img style="visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;" src="http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyNDQ*MTA2NDM3NTYmcHQ9MTI*NDQxMDc5ODI3MCZwPTE4NTM5MSZkPSZnPTEmdD*mbz1jYjdlMGYwZjcyODI*ZmMzOTg4ZjUxNmQyNTAxZjlkNCZvZj*w.gif" border="0" height="0" width="0" /><embed flashvars="song_id=27966" src="http://www.muziboo.com/swf/new_player.swf" height="112" width="272"></embed> <br /><span style="size: 0.8em;"><a href="http://www.muziboo.com/roopeshchander/music/domapo">Credits</a></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5850977-8399352891539350677?l=roop.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
