It all starts tomorrow. The road trip. The third best, say <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/apr/01/fivebest.canada.australia">some</a>, but possibly the best we might get to do.<br /><br />We're catching a flight on Saturday to Delhi, renting some Enfield Thunderbirds there, and biking off to Leh. Going a clockwise round trip of Delhi-Srinagar-Kargil-Leh-Manali-Delhi, about 2500kms in all, and will also be paying an exclusive visit to Khardung La, north of Leh, arguably the world's highest motorable road.<br /><br />Abhi is just back from a <a href="http://pixelfactory.co.in/gallery/Exploring_Ladakh/">biketrip</a> to Leh, and between the five of them on seven bikes over 14 days, they had 15 gigs of photos, 1 puncture, 1 burnt sprocket, 1 damaged suspension, 1 hairline fracture and about 15 minor injuries.<br /><br />Unlike Abhi's gang, we seven are a somewhat odd lot, without much biking experience (does trekking experience count?) With a who's who of riders looking like this:<br /><br />       The number of riders<blockquote>who have fixed bikes before: 1<br />               who ride a bike regularly: 5<br />               who have ridden bikes regularly: 6<br />               who have ridden an Enfiled for >10km: 0<br />               who have biked on long trips: 2<br />our plan does look rather audacious, don't you think?</blockquote>Wish us luck. We'll need it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5850977-7094896156728517933?l=roop.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
