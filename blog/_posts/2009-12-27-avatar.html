About the good parts first: <br/>
The visuals are *W O W*.
<i>Avatar</i> is set in the most audacious place anyone would
probably ever want to set a movie in: an alien planet. No, not
barren wastes that you see so often in sci-fi flicks, but
one as rich and complex and full of life as our own planet.
The movie makes even this ambitious setting look more than real. <br/>
 <br/>
The action is edge-of-the seat. The chases and fights are
long and well-detailed, yet not confusing. Together, the
visuals and action kept me hooked for the whole almost-three
hours. <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Avatar</i> is the most jaw-dropping-est movie of the
century that is so unbelievably fantabulous that it's
gone beyond just being a movie into an experience of 
Chuck-Norris-level awesomeness. Okay, now that the customary
over-the-top appreciation of <i>Avatar</i> is done,
we can move on to my only gripe. A big one, though.<br/>
 <br/>
It's a bit of a let down that the movie pretty much 
depends on its visuals to keep you entertained. As they say,
a fantastic Middle Earth doth not an LOTR make. Technology
is what gets this movie ashore, and ironically
the theme of the movie is: wtf are we doing with all this
technology? (Speaking of LOTR, I think it's pretty cool that they
invented an <a href="http://www.learnnavi.org/">actual language</a>
just for <i>Avatar</i>.) <br/>
 <br/>
It's probably because of that that I could feel sorrow in
the scenes where their land is getting destroyed, but when
people die or are close to dying, the feeling was more like,
"yeah, move on, guys". <br/>
 <br/>
No one-liners? None whatsoever? What's happened, James Cameron?
<i>True Lies</i> was built on one-liners (maybe they were written by
the other co-author?). Even the very-similar-themed <i>The Abyss</i>
has its goofy bits. <i>Avatar</i> kind of takes itself too seriously, eh?
(Speaking of the lines, early on in the movie, Neytiri says, 
"This is sad. Very sad only." Isn't this typical of
<a href="http://litterateuse.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/we-are-indian-and-so-is-our-english/">Indian English</a> only?) <br/>
 <br/>
The 3D was good fun. A complete absence of eye-poking ice-cream cones,
as @iyermatter <a href="http://twitter.com/iyermatter/status/6933420788">puts it</a>,
is nice. 3D is treated just like an incidental nicety, not
something to take advantage of in the movie itself.
But I would've liked a bigger screen than the one at
<a href="http://urvashicinema.com/">Urvashi</a>, and if the picture
had been sort of brighter (the glasses make it look rather dark, eh?).
How much more awesomer would it be in IMAX 3D (I'd seen <i>Antz</i> at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-Bristol">@Bristol</a>, which was
pretty cool). The 3D goggles themselves were pretty cool - they apparently
have LCD shutters (non-mechanical) in them that is synced with the projectors,
so each eye sees only alternate frames. (Source: Jomy and <a href="http://www.xpandcinema.com">Xpand</a>.) Most importantly, they could fit on
top of my own spectacles. :) <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Avatar</i> is probably a milestone in SFX technology. Some of my
all-time favourite movies have been SFX milestones too:
<i>Terminator 2</i> and <i>The Matrix</i>. They are cult classics
because they engage with you in another level beyond just 
breathtaking visuals. <i>Avatar</i> is not even trying to do
anything like that. <br/>
 <br/>
It's definitely a fantastic movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe
I would have liked it more if I hadn't read the "Oooh!" "Aah!" reviews,
but I wouldn't have watched it but for them. Catch-22? Oh, well. <br/>
 <br/>
So, watch it, sure. While this is not quite a
<a href="http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/avatar">"rebirth of cinema"</a> that has <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/12/19/hunters-avatar-review-james-cameron-succeeds-where-the-prequels-and-the-hurt-locker-failed/">"transcended stagnant notions of what cinema is"</a>,
the world that Cameron has brought to life here
is just too cool to be missed out on. Maybe, just maybe, <s>if</s>
when there's an <i>Avatar 2</i>, with the setting established, there'll
be more time for the director to do justice to this thingie called
screenplay. After all, this is the guy who gave us <i>Terminator 2</i>,
the best sequel ever.
