Well, we had this concept of a Formal Friday sometime last May at TI. It was fun seeing well-pressed blazers on people who'd been seldom seen on anything better than only slightly tattered jeans.

Turned out to be by a dummy too (due apologies to Varun).<br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/smI341aT6_k"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/smI341aT6_k" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></embed></object><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5850977-8256314215308240267?l=roop.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
