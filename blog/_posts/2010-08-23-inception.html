In <a href="http://www.uyirmmai.com/publications/bookdetails.aspx?bid=1"><i>திரைக்கதை எழுதுவது எப்படி?</i></a>
(<i>How to write a screenplay?</i>), <a href="/blog/2008/04/blog-post.html">Sujatha</a>
says most good movies
have a premise, like a What If. Like, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudhalvan">what if a television anchor gets
to become the Chief Minister for a day</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">what if we're living in a
dream world created by machines</a>. <i>Inception</i>'s simplestest what if is:
What if one could enter somebody else's dream. That premise could have
morphed into anything (apparently, as <a href="http://froogy.blogspot.com/">K</a> had told me in the cinema hall,
Nolan had first thought of a horror flick on this premise) but building
a heist movie on this is just ingenious. <br/>

<br/>
As the old adage (first <a href="/blog/2009/12/avatar.html">quoted</a> in 2009) goes, a middle earth doth not an
LOTR make. Unlike <a href="/blog/2009/12/avatar.html"><i>Avatar</i></a>, <i>Inception</i> manages to
present us with a new world, and also reserves enough time for a
fantastic plot. It's somewhat demanding of the audience, but not on the
level of <i>Memento</i> (which you're expected to watch like you read a
research paper - miss that epsilon there, and you don't know what the
heck is going on anymore). <br/>
 <br/>
The rules of the dream world - dreaming within dreaming, the sense of
time, how we fill a dream space with things, the kick - all thought
through well. No, I don't remember ever having dreams within dreams,
but, er, that's what's Nolan's point too, right? The deeper, the better,
to plant an idea undetectedly. <br/>
 <br/>
More than anything else, what I like about <i>Inception</i> is that after it
presents us with the events, we're left free to invent hypotheses to fit
the empirical knowledge (ie. what we saw on screen). While the
audaciousness of the is premise nowhere close to that of <i>The Matrix</i>,
the setting is a lot more flexible in <i>Inception</i>. It sounds odd when I
say it, but methinks <i>Inception</i> ups the audience engagement by making a
virtue of it's loose ends. <br/>

Take the gravity inconsistency, which was pricking the back of my head
right through the movie. <br/>
 <br/>
<b>Observed anomaly:</b> When the van does a somersault, the hotel turns and all,
but nothing happens in the snow level. <br/>
<b>Hypothesis 1:</b> Oh, gravity affects only the immediate next level, didn't
you know? <br/>
<b>Hypothesis 2:</b> Yusuf concocts a special drug to keep their sense of balance awake
while they sleep. But Arthur, who dreams up the drugs with which they go
to the snow level, doesn't know how to do that. <br/>
<b>Hypothesis 3:</b> Well, that would mean we'll have zero-gravity in all 
levels for half the movie. Who wants that, dumbo? <br/>
 <br/>
Even though all these hypotheses may be flawed or inconsistent with other
parts of the movie, the fact that we as an audience understand the rules
of a new system and try to fit theories to explain observations... - isn't
that awesome in terms of audience engagement? <br/>

The biggest crib I have though, is Cobb's totem, a key object in the
movie. It's the worst totem anyone could've designed. While Ariadne's
chess knight can tell you whether you're in the real world even as you
hold it in your hand, while Arthur's die can tell you that within 2
seconds of throwing it, to test reality with Cobb's totem, you have wait
like what, one minute? :) More importantly, while totems are supposed to
feel or behave oddly in the real world, Cobb's spinning top does the
reverse. It falls in the real world. If Cobb was stuck in my dream and
he spun the top, it would by default fall because I, the dreamer, would 
expect it to fall - that's what spinning tops normally do. And Cobb, as
a tourist visiting my dream, would happily go about thinking it was all
real. However, if, say, Arthur was also hanging around in the same dream,
he could throw his dice but I wouldn't know which number should come up,
so I can't make it seem like reality to him. Seriously, spinning tops,
eh? What a dumb totem! <br/>
