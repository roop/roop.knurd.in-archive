<h3>Jekyll</h3>

'Blogging from the commandline? Yay!' is what I thought of
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
when it swam into my ken, so as to say. <br/> <br/>

Jekyll is an übersimple blog generator, and by virtue of being übersimple
gives you a lot of control. You write posts as html-lets in files and
Jekyll converts them into a static html site. Host the static files
someplace, and lo! you have your blog. 
<a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> can do the hosting for you,
and best part is, Github does both publishing and version control for
the blog at one shot. True, that means versioning with 
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">the best version controller in the world</a>.
And sure, you do all this from the bash command line. 
Erm, you do use the browser, but only to preview what your post will
look like. <br/> <br/>

So when I wanted to put up a website for myself at
<a href="http://knurd.in/">knurd.in</a>
(yeah, I was pretty much addicted to
<a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/">Pratchett</a> when I'd registered that 
domain), I thought I'll give Jekyll a try rather than just link to
<a href="http://roop.blogspot.com/">my blogspot blog</a>.
After I import my past posts
using <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues#issue/24">
this rss importer</a>, create the
<a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> templates and
<code>git push</code> to Github, I have the site working at
<a href="http://roop.github.com/">roop.github.com</a>. <br/> <br/>

<h3>Google App Engine</h3>

But to tie it to the knurd.in domain, I find
that I have to pay Github (horror).
They don't ask for much, but I do prefer free over inexpensive,
thank you. So I turn to <a href="http://appspot.com/">Google App Engine</a>
to host the static html that Jekyll generates. All it takes is a simple
<a href="http://github.com/roop/roop.github.com/blob/c7f9f4020e1da210f1bfa57ffba1fc7eb6ae3bdf/app.yaml">app.yaml</a>. <br/> <br/>
