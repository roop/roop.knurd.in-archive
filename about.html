        Call me Roop. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - I
        created a blogger account. (Sorry, Moby Dick.) And I've been a
        very reluctant and occasional blogger ever since, but a blogger nevertheless.
        And, per how things normally evolve from there, here is my site.
        Behold and, er, just behold it, ok?
